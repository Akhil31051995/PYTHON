'''Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between 
two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre
of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at e
ach end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the
wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling
and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving
    the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each
batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding
side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but b
efore it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters
have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The 
game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match 
referee in international matches. They communicate

with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.'''
